## Lab 8: Quotes
Application takes in a Json file and randomly prints out quotes from famous authors.

## Feature Task
Use the file [recentquotes.json](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-java-guide/curriculum/08-oo-design-practice/recentquotes.json) to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. 
The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## How to Run Application
All dependencies have been added to the application.
Just run <b>./gradlew run</b> to install proper dependencies.
